#  Acoustic Guitar Backing Tracks Platform

Welcome to my project! this was originally designed to be a portfolio project, but I got obsessed and turned it into a music marketplace. 

Artists can upload and sell their tracks and users can register and have permanant access to the tracks that they bought. 
There is an extensive commission flow, and many of the processes of this website are automated in order to ensure minimal upkeep. 

I actually did most of the backend before I got started with the frontend. The reason for this is that I was working through freeCodeCamps full stack developer curriculum, but the backend part of it had not been created yet. I started this to start getting used to coding backend API's.

My workflow was generally like this. I would start with a Mongoose Model to define the object that I was going to be working with. After that was when I would get to work on a controller. I would then create the route file, making sure the appropriate middleware was used in order to ensure sufficient security and to also pass through the required details to identify the user. Finally this route would be imported and used within server.js. Generally the appropriate middleware used throughout was customerauth. 

I apologise if the code is somewhat out of control in some places. Although this backend has decent seperation of concerns, there are for sure things I would do differently next time. Keep in mind this is my first project of this size, and I learnt a lot along the way.

Some of the things I would change:

More organised folder structure. Keeps code maintainable.

Condense some routes into one. There are many cases where a single route could be repurposed with various query params. For example, I have so many different "get" routes, but I could have condensed this down simply by sending the request with a query and simply having one route which fills that query.

Condensing the tests down into less files. It got a bit out of control. 

A full-stack web application connecting musicians with high-quality backing tracks and custom commission services. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, featuring Stripe payments, AWS S3 storage, and comprehensive admin tooling.

## 🎯 My Role & Learning Outcomes

This project represents my journey in building production-ready web applications. Key learning areas include:

- **Full-Stack Development**: End-to-end feature implementation
- **Payment Integration**: Complex financial workflows and compliance
- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS services and scalable infrastructure
- **Database Design**: Optimized schemas and query performance
- **API Development**: RESTful design and comprehensive documentation
- **Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection

The most challenging aspect was implementing the commission system - a complex state machine managing artist-customer interactions, payment holds, and dispute resolution. This required careful consideration of edge cases and robust error handling.
