# 🎯 Fast Payout Testing & Artist Dashboard Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 🚀 Fast Payout System for Testing
- **Cart purchases automatically trigger payouts in 30 seconds** (development mode only)
- **Production mode uses safe hourly processing** 
- **Single track purchases unchanged** (still use instant Stripe splits)

### 📊 Artist Stripe Dashboard - Scheduled Payouts
- **New "Scheduled Payouts" section** shows pending money owed to artists
- **Real-time updates** with refresh button
- **Beautiful UI** with status indicators and processing info
- **Detailed breakdown** of each pending payment with source, amount, and reference

### 🧹 Automatic Cleanup System
- **Daily cleanup** removes stale/invalid money owed entries
- **Manual cleanup script** (`cleanup_money_owed.js`) for maintenance
- **Duplicate detection** based on payment intent and metadata
- **Data validation** removes corrupted entries

### 🔒 Improved Safety Features
- **Reset Account button moved** to hidden "Advanced Account Management" section
- **Double confirmation required** (confirmation dialog + typing "RESET")
- **Danger zone UI** with clear warnings
- **Collapsible section** prevents accidental clicks

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Cart Purchase Fast Testing
```bash
# 1. Start server (development mode)

# 4. Check artist dashboard - scheduled payouts should update automatically
```
